===============

Useful Python script to retrieve IceCast2 stream details.

Requirements
===============

- Beautiful Soup 4
- Python 2.7

Installing Beautiful Soup 4 on Debian Wheezy
==============

If you already have Python Setup Tools (easy_install), please do:

- sudo easy_install beautifulsoup4

Otherwhise, install it first:

- sudo apt-get install python-setuptools

Installing Beautiful Soup 4 on Mac OSX
==============

For that you have to use pip, since easy_install doesn't put the Beautiful Soup in the proper packages directory.

- sudo pip install beautifulsoup4

No pip installed on your Mac yet? So do it:

- sudo easy_install pip

Now install BS4 and you are now good to go.
